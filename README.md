MXB362 Advanced Visualisation and Data Science

## Overview
This case study proposes developing an advanced visualization tool to enhance public understanding of COVID-19's impact in Singapore. By addressing limitations in current visualizations—such as misleading scales and excessive color gradients—the study aims to create a more effective representation of the pandemic's spread. The tool will utilize choropleth maps and spatio-temporal animations to display COVID-19 case density and movement over time, leveraging data on case locations and timings. The goal is to produce clear, actionable insights that help the public make informed decisions and improve future pandemic preparedness.
